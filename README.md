# Getting and cleaning data course Project assingment
This respository is for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project. 
It has instructions on how to run the script on Human Activity recognition dataset 

## Data Set:
The data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" can be be downloaded [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). I have downloaded this data through script itself.

## Files:
1.	CodeBook.md file is a code book that describes the variables, the data, transformations/ work that is performed to clean up the data
2.	run_analysis.R performs the steps required as described in the course project:
    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3.	AnalyzedData.txt is the filnal data that is exported after performing all the steps described/mentioned above.
